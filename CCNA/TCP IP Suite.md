# The current conceptual model actually in use in modern networks

## OSI vs TCP/IP
### 4) Application
=[[OSI Model#The Top 3]]
### 3) Transport
=[[OSI Model#Segmenting]]
### 2) Internet
=[[OSI Model#Addressing]]
### 1) Link
=[[OSI Model#Linking]]

#### People still use OSI terms when referring to, say for instance, a "Layer-4 problem"

#### There are several other nomenclatures for these "Layers," so I may hear a differently named one for the same exact thing

##### Below is a diagram demonstrating that the [[TCP IP Suite#Application]] and [[TCP IP Suite#Transport]] layers remain intact as the data makes its way through the routers and internet, establishing "process-to-process" and "host-to-host" communication.
